Exploring and playing random stupid/interesting stuff found on Kaggle with my friend Nova.
Trying to use Keras instead of Pytorch.
Trying different feature extractor (VGG16, VGG19, Resnet 50...) to FC layers from scratch and see if anything interesting happens.
Apparently the data quality and sample size is only good enough to test codes and see if it runs.
